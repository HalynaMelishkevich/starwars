Title: Should get correct endpoints information
Priority: Critical
Coverage reason:
The next set of reasons make this test a Critical priority and explains why it need to be automated:
1. Nothing will work if base URL is down.
2. If some endpoints changed - then the rest of tests would fail.
3. If more endpoints are added - then the test scope need to be expanded.
But before that test results would give misleading results and management can not rely on them.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Send request to 'https://swapi.co/api/' endpoint.
Expected result:
1. Endpoints information corresponds to requirements (see /support/testData.js file).

1. Send request to 'https://swapi.co/api/people/schema' endpoint.
Expected result:
1. Schema of /people endpoint corresponds to requirements (see /support/schema/people.json file).
