BASIC CHECKS

Coverage reason:
The next set of reasons make this test a Critical priority and explains why it need to be automated:
1. Nothing will work if base URL is down.
2. If some endpoints changed - then the rest of tests would fail.
3. If more endpoints are added - then the test scope need to be expanded.
But before that test results would give misleading results and management should not rely on them.

Title: Should get correct endpoints information
Priority: Critical
Steps to reproduce:
1. Send request to 'https://swapi.co/api/' endpoint.
Expected result:
1. Response code is 200.
2. Endpoints information corresponds to requirements (see /support/testData.js file).

#######################
SCHEMA CHECKS

Coverage reason:
Checking schema is a crucial point before validating the data. If schema is changed - then tests should be adjusted.
But before that test results would give misleading results and management should not rely on them.

VALIDATION RESPONSES BY SCHEMA

Coverage reason:
Each response should correspond to it's expected schema.
If server returns some data, but not in the format that client is expecting - then contract is not met and test results are misleading.
