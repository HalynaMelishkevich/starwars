BASIC CHECKS

Coverage reason:
The next set of reasons make this test a Critical priority and explains why it need to be automated:
1. Nothing will work if base URL is down.
2. If some endpoints changed - then the rest of tests would fail.
3. If more endpoints are added - then the test scope need to be expanded.
But before that test results would give misleading results and management should not rely on them.

SCHEMA CHECKS

Coverage reason:
Checking schema is a crucial point before validating the data. If schema is changed - then tests should be adjusted.
But before that test results would give misleading results and management should not rely on them.
